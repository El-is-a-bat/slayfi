# What is this project

I've used some application launchers like ROFI and WOFI, and they may be edited to suit my needs 
(Cyberpunk 2077 design, different animations, etc.), 
but the differences between GTK and Web CSS, as well as the much greater capabilities 
of the second pushed me to create this project
So, this is an app runner with the power of web styling
